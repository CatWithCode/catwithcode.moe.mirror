    <h1>HyprLain: My first Dot Files</h1>
    <p>Not much to say about it. I made dot files based on a game/anime. Very simple but effective. Many files are missing (mainly wallpapers and sound effects). But there is no way to include them. They are copyrighted. I documented a way to recreate them (and yes, it took me at least as much time to figure it out as it feels like while reading, which is like several days). Was it worth it? No. Would I do it again if I could time travel? Yes. ;P</p>
