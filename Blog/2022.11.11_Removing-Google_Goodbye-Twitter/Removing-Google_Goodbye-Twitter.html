    <h1>Removing Google from my Website and leaving Twitter</h1>    
    <p>Most search engines finally found my Website and indexed it (Everything from DuckDuckGo to even Bing). Now I don't need to force any indexing anymore and decided to remove the Google-HTML-Tag from this Website completely. Now that the search engines do the indexing them self I don't need to force it through Google anymore. That means in the near future I can not use the google search console and don't see anything google search related information about my website anymore because google will not know that I am more or less the owner of this website. Privacy GO! But Google still can see everything about you... well, sucks to use google.</p>
    <p>And the other thing is I'm leaving Twitter. Why is self explanatory. You can only contact me through GitHub from now on.</p>
