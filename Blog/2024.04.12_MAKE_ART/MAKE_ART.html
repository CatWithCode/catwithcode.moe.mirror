    <h1>Art is NOT Content!</h1>
    <p>Art and every kind of creation, especially in digital media, get's called content nowadays. From paintings to games to music, from videos to even books. How much, how long, how good? that is all people talk about. You could say it is just a word, but it represents a deeper issue with the way people look at art today: it is, for most, mindless stimulation. It is content.</p>
    <p>I will leave the essays to the writers out there, but what I will do is fight against content and fight for my art. Whether it's code, programming, 3D modelling, game development, writing, reviewing, building things out of wood, drawing, ... or a blog it is ART. Everything we create with passion and love is art. Call me prentatios or think what I am saying is "cringe". I love what I do and I fight for it!</p>
    <p>Stop using platforms and systems that enforce contentification. Buy music from your favourite artists, if possible always get the art in a way were you support an artist directly and don't force them to make more so they can sustain themselves from clicks (YouTube, Spotify, short video platforms (yes, we don't say the name of that stupit platform here ðŸ¤®)).</p>
    <p>Whatever you do, just make sure you do it in a way that helps your favourite artists. Its not hard, getting a UHD BluRay drive ;) and connecting it to any computer and being able to then have your media on any of your devices is easier and better than you think (ever noticed how bad the quality is from streaming platforms, believe me you will). No need for a cloud service that takes ownership away from you. I will now do everything in my power to stand behind my ideals. I am fed up with this s*it! It has to stop!</p>
    <p>Fight against content! FIGHT FOR YOUR ART!</p>
