    <h1>Expecting Software/Hardware is wrong</h1>
    <p>What do I mean by that? I mean expecting people to have an Android/iPhone phone with the Play-Store/App-Store on it so you can download a stupid data-harvesting app so you can get your concert tickets (if you know who I mean, you know who I mean). It doesn't even stop at private companies, even the government expects you to have one these days.</p>
    <p>I can understand that 99.9% of people have phones, so you can expect them to be able to download a service, but it should not be like this. Some people just do not want to use Android and have an IOS device or even rarer, use Ubuntu Touch or something. Yes, I know they are the outliers, but forcing them into a proprietary system to do things is wrong, or expecting them to have a phone at all.</p>
    <p>Schools should not be able to force their students to use a copy of a spyware operating system like ChromeOS on a waste machine, or to have a spyware operating system like Windows at all, which is also security nightmare.</p>
    <p>No one is asking anyone to support 1,000,000 different platforms, architectures and operating systems, but with all the cross platform tools at our disposal, there is no good reason to write a stupid app that only works on a specific configuration of software and hardware. Web apps (which can run offline, by the way, I do not ask for online services) can do the job just as well, and more often than not the apps are just a shitty electron apps with some stupit checks for the system.</p>
    <p>The best thing is that many services that require an app to access them (like concert tickets) are tied to an account, so, why do I need the app, if I can just launch the web browser and access my shit that way? Because its locked behind your app thats also just a memory eating browser.</p>
    <p>You get it, I am pissed. This has happened so many times in the last few months and I am definitely not alone with this thought.</p>
