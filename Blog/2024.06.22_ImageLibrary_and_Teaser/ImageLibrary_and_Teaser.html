    <h1>Image Librarys are now available and a Teaser for my upcoming Project</h1>
    <p>Not much to say about it. It is accessible in the header bar and contains images I want to share. The images are higher quality then usual around here BUT still heavily compressed or edited to keep the size down. Web space is expensive.</p>
    <p>I have also added a teaser to my upcuming project. It is still in Alpha and not ready to be shown publicly, but I can already show some Teaser images. Nothing in the images is final! Hope you like what you can see already.</p>
