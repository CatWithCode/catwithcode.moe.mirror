    <h1>Forcing Triple Screen Gaming without Eyefinity or Surround on Linux (KDE)</h1>    
    <p>This is outdated. More updated information: <a href="/Blog/2023.10.16_No_Desktop_Is_Ready_For_Ultrawide/No_Desktop_Is_Ready_For_Ultrawide.html">/Blog/2023.10.16_No_Desktop_Is_Ready_For_Ultrawide/No_Desktop_Is_Ready_For_Ultrawide.html</a></p>
    <p>I wanted to run my triple screen gaming setup on Linux, unfortunately I had to do a lot of research to find a way to do it. I tried several desktops (GNOME, Wayfire, ...) and the only one with the performance AND configuration for it was KDE. After a lot of research I wrote a KWin script that changes the position and size of the focused window. It is extremely simple. For most games I just use Gamescope to force them into the resolution. Very often I have to change some things in the games config files for the resolution and the FOV (standard ultrawide / triple screen gaming stuff LOL :S).</p>
    <p>The KWin-Script and the gamescope command's: <li><a href="https://github.com/CatWithCode/KDETripleScreenGaming">https://github.com/CatWithCode/KDETripleScreenGaming</a></li></p>
    <br>
    <p>Also: Why is the documentation for KWin scripts so bad? It is actually hard to find things about it , how to do things in general and what APIs there are... .</p>
