    <h1>Finally! RSS-Feed for CatWithCode.moe x3</h1>
    <p>A very VERY simple implementation and still handmade because my custom webpage tool is still in the early stages of development. Hope you like it! I have added items for old entries with very basic information. New ones will probably get a custom text and formatting if I'm not too lacy, but for any old entry its just not worth it. Now everyone can keep up with my BS. Probably no one will, lol, but its there now ;).</p>
    <p>Just add the "RSS.xml"-Feed-Link as a source in your RSS-Reader. The XML-File will be updated every time I add something to my Blog. Means: Do not download and add the XML directly. The reader will not find any new entries! Add the link to it as a source!: https://catwithcode.moe/Feed/RSS.xml</p>
    <p>The Feed-Link from now on will be always in the header. It is also below and above this text :D:</p>
    <p><a href="https://catwithcode.moe/Feed/RSS.xml">https://catwithcode.moe/Feed/RSS.xml</a></p>
