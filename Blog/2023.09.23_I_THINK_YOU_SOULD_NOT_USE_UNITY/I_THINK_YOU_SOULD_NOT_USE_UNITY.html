    <h1>I THINK YOU SOULD NOT USE UNITY!</h1>
    <h3>This is an opinion piece:</h3>
    <p>They tried to change their model on how they make money by forcing a payment with every installation if your product meets certain conditions. What came out of it is irrelevant. Just the fact that they tried something like this shows how far a few people behind the company would go, risking the income and livelihood of so many costumers, just to make more money. That's besides the probability that the people behind this idea probably have enough money for 10 lifetimes. This is why I am removing all Unity related posts from my blog. You can still find them on older commits of this blog, but I will not link to them and will not help you find them. Use Godot, Unreal or something else, preferably Open Source.</p>
