    <p>Project CWC has left the state of proof of concept around 3 month ago with the full commitment to it. Next to my daily work there is sadly not as much time as I would like to invest into it but I work nearly every day multiple hours on it.</p>
    <p>Music, Soundeffects and in-game artwork takes up far more time then expected. And it also grinds my creativity fully up for the evenings that I work with it. I hope I can finish the Soundeffects and the Level mapping soon, so I can start implementing them into the game world and finish the first area. UI and Dialog's will probably eat a lot of time too.</p>
    <p>I was closer to multiple burnouts than I want to admit... . But no worries, I have found a schedule for me that prevents this from happening... for now.</p>
    <p>I already got asked to show more of the game but as every dev know, showing early work is uncomfortable because u want to finish just one more thing, and make it look as good and as final as possible before showing anything. I don't want to step into the trap so many dev's step in too, showing more then you have, and keep showing instead of developing.</p>
    <p>Ok and what is this post actually about, except me just writing random thoughts? An announcement, that at some point in the next few weeks I will add a sub page to my website for the game with a dev-log section. I will probably have to extend the script for it and at least try making it look a little better the a dev webpage because it will be promotional to some extend. Meaning: Next to game dev and real life the time I need to create it will be either a few days of focusing on it or working on it next to the rest witch will make the time needed far longer the really necessary.</p>
    <p>I was also thinking about a subdomain or a full custom domain, but the way I want to host my stuff independently, it would be a bit more expensive then it would be worth.</p>
    <p>Working alone on such a big project is hard I must to admit. I know now, why immersive sims take for ever to come out.</p>
    <p>I hope that the few people reading this, are as exited as I am. Stay tuned!</p>

    <p>Also: Thanks to the work on my website the last few weeks, indexing should work good now, writing entries is easier than ever in the past, and the best part: It is fully archived and thanks to the full path relativity it can work completely offline.</p>
