    <p>Well... that was quick. I'm already finished with moving my website from github pages to its own domain and webhost. The old site is now an archive and will only redirect the user to this site and will be deleted as soon as the search engine picks up the change. And now the big question: Why .moe? Answer: It's funny, cheap and fits the technical focus, nerdy atmosphere and style of my blog. I originally wanted .io but... wow is that domain expensive. Sorry not sorry. LOL</p>
    <p>The design will probably change soon. I have started a few new hobbies and hope to be able to post and change more here with the help of them. See you all soon.</p>
