    <h1>The most convoluted Vinyl Setup imaginable</h1>
    <p>For reasons I have a Turntable that I can not use currently. I wanted to be able to use it, even though it is relatively rare. The easiest way I found was to use my guitar mix panel and my PC.</p>
    <p>To make it as easy as possible to understand, I will lay out the whole chain below. Have fun reading:</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>Turntable >> Magnetic Preamplifier >> Guitar Mixer >> PC >> Mic2Speaker >> External headphone DAC/AMP >> Headphones</b></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <pr>You will probably ask yourself if there is a loss of quality or if it even makes sense to listen to vinyl when you have to push the signal through 5 different ways to transmit music in analogue and digital multiple times... idk. The DJ thinks it works:</pr>
