    <h1>The new Design is finally here</h1>
    <p>I will really try not to make all the gifs too annoying / performance intensive XD. But I will allow myself at least for this post to put a lot of stupit useless Assistent gif and more everywhere. Just for fun.</p>
    <p>After months of learning how to use 3D modeling software, drawing, designing and conceptualizing, I can finally use this new skill to redesign my homepage, as I mentioned a few posts ago. It will also help me with many other hobbies like 3D printing and game development.</p>

    <p>And yes, we go even further back in design language, rotating gifs and background images here we goooooo :D. But I will keep the structure of the pages the same as it has always been because it is a good blend of modern and oldscool basic design and layouts (I know this makes no sense). And if anyone is wondering what the old icon was, I mentioned it in my first post, but the short story is this: It is/was the sprite of a playable character from a game I was working on some time ago. The game and the idea are still alive... but the game-project (build with Unity) has been abandoned. The project is now under development in Godot, when or if this game will be released is unclear. It is just a fun hobby project from time to time for me. The new icon is more or less a mascot for my website/web-presents/-persona under the label CatWithCode (like the old one was too). It is not based on anything and does not have a name yet.</p>

    <p>I have linked information and useful tools I used to learn / get started with 3D modeling.</p>
