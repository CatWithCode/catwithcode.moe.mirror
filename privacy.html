    <h1>Privacy and Cookies:</h1>    
    <p>This Website is hosted on porkbun.com. This website is only made from static HTML documents that are displayed in your browser. This Website is obviously open source and the code can be viewed as a Code-Repository:</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/CatWithCode/catwithcode.moe.mirror">catwithcode.moe.mirror - Repository</a>
    <br>
    <p>Porkbun.com itself as the host can collect stuff. What information they can potentially collect from visitors (if any) can be found in there policys. I don't do anything with cookies. I coded this website myself without anything external in use. Thanks to that I know exactly what my HTML, CSS and JS files can do. Cookies are something they cannot do. What your browser dose on its own, like pre-caching of Links or similar, I don't know and I don't care. Thats your issue.</p>
    <b>More information about the provider for the domain and web hoster:</b>

    <p>If you view the GitHub-Mirror of my website, I can see information every developer on GitHub can see when someone is looking at there GitHub Repositorys. If a Link on this website goes to a external website, then there rules count at this point and I have no control over the code there and what they do with your data! If your browser is configured in a certain way it even can load links into memory without you even clicking on them. If that's the case that's on you. Code and hosted information on the linked pages can change in the future! That is not in my hand! If a link goes to a bad location in the future just send me a message (look at the "CONTACT"-Page for more information) and I remove the link from the website as fast as possible.</p>
    <h1>I don't care about you and your data! Leave me alone.</h1>
    <p>Now that I'm hosting my website with a real web host, I can potentially see a lot more information than I could on the github pages. I now "own" the hosted website and domain and can do a lot more with it. I don't care about your data and I never will. And what web hosting, domain ownership and DNS management potentially allows me to see, I don't even know. Inform yourself. This is just the way the internet works, bro.</p>
