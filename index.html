    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>    
    <p>I'm a girl from Germany and work as a Software Developer. I love programming and tinkering. Thanks to this I discover a lot of random stuff in my daily life. From modding old flip phones to installing an obscure Linux Distro. I always wanted a way to document my findings securely and discoverable and that is why you are probably here now. I also sometimes just post opinions or random stuff from my life. Have fun!</p>
