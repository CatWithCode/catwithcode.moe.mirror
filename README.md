# catwithcode.moe
This is a source code mirror of my website, where I post my daily discoveries and random thoughts. It may happen that I reset this repository from time to time because of bugs I want to fix, which means that the history of commits is not and will not be complete from point zero.

# How to Update:
The "DeployWebsite.sh"-Script should do everything that is needed to update any part of the Website. Just write a new Entry and after executing the Script everything should be linked relatively and statically correctly.
